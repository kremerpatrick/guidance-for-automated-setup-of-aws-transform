# Guidance for Automated Setup of AWS Transform

## Overview

This guidance provides automated Infrastructure as Code (IaC) solutions for deploying AWS Transform resources to modernize and migrate your workloads to AWS. Choose the appropriate guide below based on your specific workload type.

### Benefits

**Simplified Setup**: Infrastructure as Code automates AWS Transform deployment and configuration, reducing setup time and manual steps.

**Secure Foundation**: Implements AWS security best practices through IAM Identity Center configuration and role-based access control.

**Guided Approach**: Provides step-by-step instructions and templates for configuring AWS Transform and associated services.

## VMware Workloads

For organizations modernizing VMware workloads, this [guide](READMEvmware.md) walks you through the complete journey from discovery and assessment of your on-premises VMware environment to migration execution. It covers RVTools inventory collection, AWS Application Discovery Service integration, intelligent network conversion with graph neural networks for wave planning, and orchestrated migration using AWS Application Migration Service. The guidance supports both hub-and-spoke and isolated networking models to match your on-premises network segments.

## .NET Workloads

For organizations using .NET applications, this [guide](READMEdotnet.md) provides an automated approach to deploying AWS Transform for .NET resources. It streamlines the setup process by automating the provisioning of required AWS services and security controls, accelerating time-to-value while ensuring adherence to AWS best practices and security standards throughout your .NET modernization journey.
